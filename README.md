Machine Learning Political Indicators Dataset

We  introduce  a  database  of  institutional  variables  using  machine  learning techniques. We perform exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on 32 commonly-cited measures of institutional quality and stability. Our results reduce these 32 variables to 9 theoretically relevant factors: Democracy (based on measures of electoral competition, political dispersion, and the polity 2 index); protest (based on numbers of strikes, riots, and demonstrations); within-regime instability (based on measures of division within the governing coalition); credibility (based on the prevalence of political and economic crises); adverse regime change (based on  coups, purges, other sudden changes in the executive branch); flexibility (based on executive and veto  player  turnover and  democracy);  regime instability  (based on  nonviolent changes  in the  executive  and  legislature);  violence (based  on the  presence of political violence); and transparency (based on measures of regime durability and the absence of fraud). Relative to current measures, our database has the advantage that the factors we derive are easily reproducible, relatively uncorrelated, robust to missing values, and adaptive to (i.e. "learn" from) the incorporation of new data. 

We include downloads for this dataset in RData, CSV, and Stata (DTA) formats. Other formats available on request. 

We also provide replication code for R. 

We provide the data and code to use, share, and modify on the understanding that you cite the most recent version of the paper.
